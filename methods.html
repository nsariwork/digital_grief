        <h2>Word Definition</h2>
        <p>Before going deeper into the implication of the phrase digital grief, I think it’s important to see the meaning and origin of individual   words.</p>
        <p>Understanding where words come from and how it became to be could help us understand the multiple implications, track their evolution, and   compare what they used to signify and what they signify today.</p>

        <h2>Mind Map</h2>
        <p>mind mapping is a visualization of expansion of ideas. I find this process helpful for myself as my mind tend to run a mile a minute and lost track of how I get to the end result. Documenting thought process this way could potentially open up new possibilities, methods, or subtopics that are often oversighted.</p>
        <p>The mind map started with the word “digital” and “grief” separately. Each word expanded into related words, topics, and opposites. At the end, a lot of common topics between the two words were found. This mind map could go on and on, but I decided to put a stop as I’ve found enough commonalities between the two words for now.</p>

      <div id="secondary_research_grouping">
        <h2>Secondary Research: Grouping</h2>
        <p>There are two different perspectives on digital grief in this study; digital technology and spaces that assist humans grieve, and how us humans grieve digital technology and spaces. The two approaches are then further expanded by grouping the study materials into four subcategories: social media and grief; digital memorials and spaces for grieving; grief-assisting technology; and grieving robots.</p>
        <p>This categorization was made to make comparisons between different reading materials that share common catalysts. Each categories are not mutually exclusive, in fact, they tend to overlap. For example, as social media becomes a common avenue for grief, many turn the social media profiles of the dead themselves into online memorials. This instance would fall under both the first, second, and, by extention, the third category too.</p>
        <p>The following pages are the bibliography for this study and how they are grouped into the subcategories mentioned before.</p>
        <p>The bibliography consists of reading materials I have stumbled upon before starting this project, the ones that raised my questions around digital grief, and some that I came across when I was putting together the project proposal.</p>

        <h2>Secondary Research: Timeline Comparison</h2>
        <p>Understanding the timeline and when each material was published is important to the topic. We live in an everchanging environment, with  relatively quick access to information through technology. Social media in the 2000s existed differently than the way social media exists today.  It’s pertinent to the research to take a step back and look at the research materials within the context of the time and place it was written in.</p>
        <p>For that reason, a visual of this information would help the readers understand how each materials relate to its time and each other. This   perspective helps me understand where outdated perspectives and biases might have come from.</p>

        <h2>Secondary Research: Reading Response</h2>
        <p>Research is not a linear process. There is a lot of back and forth, expanding and narrowing ideas, and endless questioning. A lot of the methods listed prior this page were formed after going through the study materials and receiving feedback from my instructor.</p>
        <p>The reading response to my study material will be the main focus in this document, where I will be critically analysing each material through multiple lenses and pulling up relevant examples. I will provide relevant pictures, diagrams, and direct quotes from the study material itself or other works that are cited in it.</p>
        <p>I wish to present these reading responses raw and closer to my initial responses. With minimal editing, some thoughts might not be as polished as readers expect them to be, with several tangents off the main topics. After all, this document was meant to serve as a documentation and prototype for my research that I wish to continue in the future.</p>
